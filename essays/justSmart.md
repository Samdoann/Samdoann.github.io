  Anyone can ask questions and some would say they often hear too many "dumb questions" Well I don't believe there is such a thing as a "dumb question", but we can make these questions into SMART questions. By being more precise and informative about your problem. In a writing  named "How To Ask Questions The 
  Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond, Eric shows us exactly how to ask questions the SMART way. The main topics Eric mentioned are about what to do before you ask, when to ask, be precise, and many more tips on what to do or what not to do. One of the main points that I took away from his reading was to be precise, 
  but not not overload questions with a huge volume of data. Before reading Eric's writing I didn't think about how overloading a question with information would do more harm than good. I now understand that to be more precise and simple the question can make it a lot easier to answer as. 

## An example of a good question
  
  ECMAScript 6 introduced the let statement.
  I've heard that it's described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword.
  What are the differences? When should let be used instead of var?

  Looking through StackoverFlow, I was able to come across this SMART question above. Keep in mind that this was asked 14 years ago, so not much learning information could've been out at this time. This is a SMART question because they've said what they understand and what they don't. After they stated what they understood, now they asked a question that was clear and not overly complicated. The person who answer this question knows
  exactly what the person was asking for and gave a response that everyone could understand.

## An example of a bad question

  Hello Stackoverflow community, I got this code for faq collapse but it doesn't work
  HTML
  (given code here)
  
  This is an example of a bad question because the person here doesn't explain what the program is trying to do, and where in the code they're receiving the error. This requires the reader to look through the entire code to understand what they're trying to do, and then find out where the error could possibly be. When 
  I found this question with no replies or answers proving that this is not a good question to ask as it is very difficult or annoying to answer.
