As a Computer Science major learning being told to leant a new language of code shouldn't come as a shock. So as a class we're told to learn JavaScript, I've heard of JavaScript before from my friends and classmates so I knew I had to learn at somepoint. 
One of the main things I've heard is that it's very similar to Java more like an updated version of it. Since I've heard a little of what JavaScript is like I was very excited to see how it compares to Java. Keep in mind I only learned two languages prior to JavaScript
one of them being Java like I mentioned earlier and Python, but I need to freshen up on Python as I haven't used the language in a long time.

## Learning the code

One of the first things I noticed when learning how to write JavaScript was the simplicity compared to Java. For example in JavaScript to declare variables it requires either "let", "var", or "const". In Java its "int", "string", "boolean", "float", and more that i can't think of right now. This isn't something that 

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
