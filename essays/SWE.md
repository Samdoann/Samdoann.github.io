## My Thoughts on SWE
Over the past year or so, there seems to be trend of making of fun of those who are currently studying software engineering. This is due to the fact of major companies laying off a lot of their employees, so those that graduate won't find a job due to the market of hiring software engineers. Now this topic scares a lot of people and it scares me too, but it isn't something that we can control. If you really want to study software engineering, but are too afraid of the fact that you won't find a job. Then this isn't the field for you. I wanted to go into this field because I enjoyed learning about computers and makes one work. Even if I can't find a job after I graduate I will have no regrets taking this major as I've enjoyed every part of the journey so far. 

## Part 1

Agile Project Management is something that I'll be using for the rest of my career, and I'm glad I've learned it now while taking this course in software engineering. Agile project management is an approach to managing projects that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It originated in the software development industry but has since been adopted across various fields due to its effectiveness in handling complex and rapidly changing projects. Agile Project management is a continuous cycle of design, develop, test, deploy, anf review. I was able to receive first-hand experience because of SWE, and even if I decide to not follow the path of being a software developer this is a skill I find very useful as working in a team setting is something I am guaranteed to be doing in the future.
