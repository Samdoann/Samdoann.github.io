Prior to learning how to code with HTML, I didn't know how different it would be compared to the other languages like python and Java. Once I understood that HTML is a language used to help design the appearance of a website I become more interested as this isn't something I've done before. Learning the basics of HTML was easy at first, but putting it together became a bit tricky to me. As I start to compare my understanding of HTML to others I felt bad, because it seemed everyone else was understanding it way faster than I was. I believed this because during a class activity, as we were working in pairs it felt like I was the only one lost, and other students were fine while doing the assignment. 

## Bootstrap

As we start to learn and understand more about HTML we are introduced to BootStrap 5. Which I thought at first was another language similar to HTML, so I got confused with why we were learning this because we haven't used HTML yet to make really good-looking websites. As I start to learn about BootStrap 5, I understood that we are still using HTML, but now this is where we get to really design these nice looking websites. My first impressions about BootStrap was that it's a language built with classes that does most of the dirty work for you. At first I would say that my experience trying to learn BootStrap 5 was harder than learning HTML because there is a lot that BootStrap can do, so there is a lot of information to cover. Even though BootStrap was hard at first I really wanted to become good at as I saw the potential with how much this could help me design a website. Since BootStrap is the first UI Framework I've used, I want to learn what other UI Frameworks have been developed and if they serve different purposes.

Going forward I want to keep getting better at using BootStrap because I believe that this is a very essential tool to design websites to look how they look today.
