Prior to learning how to code with HTML, I didn't know how different it would be compared to the other languages like python and Java. Once I understood that HTML is a language used to help design the appearance of a website I become more interested as this isn't something I've done before. Learning the basics of HTML was easy at first, but putting it together became a bit tricky to me. As I start to compare my understanding of HTML to others I felt bad, because it seemed everyone else was understanding it way faster than I was. I believed this because during a class activity, as we were working in pairs it felt like I was the only one lost, and other students were fine while doing the assignment. 

## Bootstrap

As we start to learn and understand more about HTML we are introduced to BootStrap 5. Which I thought at first was another language similar to HTML, so I got confused with why we were learning this because we haven't used HTML yet to make really good-looking websites. As I start to learn about BootStrap 5, I understood that we are still using HTML, but now this is where we get to really design these nice looking websites. My first impressions about BootStrap was that its sort of a language buit with classes that does most of the dirty work for you.
