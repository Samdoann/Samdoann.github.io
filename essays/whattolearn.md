## A little about me

I've  been fortunate enough to learn many unique skills in life, like how to fix a car, how to build a house, and how to farm. Now I'm on a journey to get a BS degree in Computer Science. This has been the most difficult thing I've had to do so far, but as I go along it shows to be worth the frustration and time.
I'm at a point in my degree where I might be able to start to see what Computer Science is really about. With the previous skills that I learned, I hope to incorporate them into what I'm learning now. I have an interest in cybersecurity with the field being my main focus right now.

## Expectations

Going into this class of software engineering the main thing I hope to learn is how to build my website and make it functionable. I've never been a part of any big coding projects or have made anything I found interesting. I want to be able to develop something I can proudly show to my friends and family. 
Maybe it could be a website that could be used for their benefit. Group projects might be a little scary to me because I don't like to let other people down, I know a lot of people in this class are more experienced than me, but I hope to have a lot of fun. I also would like to learn how I can use Software Engineering 
in the cybersecurity space. Well, I guess if you understand how a website is built then you understand what you can do to protect it, that's just a guess for now. 

This class seems to be very promising for my future and I want to make the most out of it. I want to start making friends or connections with other students so we can help each other in the future. I know this class won't be easy as it's been stated multiple times, but I know I'll be giving it my best because if not why 
am I still here.
