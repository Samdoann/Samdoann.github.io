Changing coding environments hasn't been a new or surprised thing to do while learning how to code. Coming into my third year as CS major, I've had the chance to use multiple coding environment. The first being built directly into the website I was learning how to code in. The website was called zyBooks, and it provided a very beginner-friendly experience. Another similar experience I had with web-integrated coding environments was FreeCodeCamp. The first coding environment I've used outside of these websites is VSCode. Using an application like VSCode made me feel like I was actually coding because, using these websites, it felt like I was on training wheels, but now I get to use something real. I see these changes or steps in my environment as an improvement on myself slowly becoming something more and more.

Just recently I've had to make another change for the better and use IntelliJ which is a popular integrated development environment (IDE). Which will be the first IDE I've used as VSCode isn't IDE and is just an advance text editor with a lot of extensions, since most of the tools you would like to use won't come built in or integrated it is not a typical IDE. Which is why I'm saying IntelliJ will be the first for me. So far the experience has been very helpful and nice especially using the ESLint extension. This allows me to have my code look more consistent and pretty. I can see ESLint being very useful especially when it comes to group projects where multiple people will be adding their own style of code into a project. It provides errors in cases that I wouldn't think needed any changes, like spacing between functions or the one I find the most helping is when it shows it you've used a function or variable. When writing code of course you also check that your object or function your writing gets used or declared properly. It gives a lot of peace of mind when I don't think I can go back to anything else without noticing a big difference in my code. I can of course adjust to how I right code, but I see ESLint working like an always on grammer check, so it's really nice to have.

Learning about new tools or environments really changes what I can imagine, it opens a new door into a chapter of my career as a student. I understand that I have a lot more to learn, and I want to be as ready as soon as possible to learn more about what a career in software engineering could look like. So I won't be shocked or overwhelmed by whatever challenges I may encounter. IntelliJ truly represents the first significant step I've taken into a world of endless possibilities.
