  As a Computer Science major learning being told to learn a new language of code shouldn't come as a shock. So as a class we're told to learn JavaScript, I've heard of JavaScript before from my friends and classmates so I knew I had to learn at some point. 
One of the main things I've heard is that it's very similar to Java more like an updated version of it. Since I've heard a little of what JavaScript is like I was very excited to see how it compares to Java. Keep in mind I only learned two languages before JavaScript
one of them being Java as I mentioned earlier and Python, but I need to freshen up on Python as I haven't used the language in a long time. 

## Learning the code

One of the first things I noticed when learning how to write JavaScript was the simplicity compared to Java. For example in JavaScript to declare variables it requires either "let", "var", or "const". In Java it's "int", "string", "boolean", "float", and more that I can't think of right now. Also when it comes to defining a function or class. That was something that took a while for me to get used to in Java was declaring functions and classes. At first glance, the syntax for Java doesn't look too different, but when it came to solving certain problems I noticed I couldn't use this solution to solve this problem in Java. For example, swapping two indexes with each other in the same list. In Java, it took me a temp value with a for loop, but in JavaScript, I can write [array[a], array[b]] = [array[b], array[a]] and this code would swap the two items in the array.

I like how JavaScript was taught because each question provided a little bit of depth on what is supposed to happen or why it's happening. The user interface was very friendly and simple so that helped the learning environment. If I need help because I just can't my code to work there are help tools that I can access without needing to use other forms of help. 

In class while learning JavaScript we also did a practice WOD (workout of the day), I agree that these WODs are necessary to see how you can perform under pressure. So far I haven't completed any on the first try though hopefully, as this semester goes on I will be able to be more efficient at writing and figuring out a good algorithm in the expected time frame. 

## Final Thoughts

I'm excited to see how JavaScript will be implemented in future projects or lessons. So far I really do enjoy this learning style, and how the class is formatted.
