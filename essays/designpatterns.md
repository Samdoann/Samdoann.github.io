## The reason
Coding tasks and problems are frequently very diverse from one another, but they are also similar. Although the goal and substance may vary, most coding errors and problems have a lot in common. As such, it's likely that you will encounter problems that you have encountered before. Or maybe when you encounter the issue a second time, you have already discovered a better approach and have begun utilizing it. The core of design patterns is precisely this type of issue solving. It's almost like having the answer to a problem figured out before you run across itâ€”a kind of recipe for fixing these common issues.

More specifically, there are three distinct sorts of design patterns according to the gang-of-four: behavioral, structural, and creational. Different design patterns, such as the Factory or Singleton design patterns, are included in each of these areas. Each of these design patterns aids in resolving possible issues that might develop if they weren't used. For instance, to prevent potential data overwriting that could result in problems, the singleton design pattern guarantees that an object exists in a single instance and provides a global access point to the instance. As you can see, these design patterns are a kind of preventative approach to make sure there are no issues rather than just remedies.

Now, returning to my code and design patterns. Which of these code design patterns have I used? After going through the design patterns, I have to admit that I had never even considered using a number of them. Although I am aware of how to utilize it and its possible benefits, I have never heard of it as a means of maybe averting problems in the future. Maybe because the programs I have created up to this point have been so simple, but I haven't even used basic design patterns like singletons. But now that I'm aware of these ideas, there's no reason I shouldn't begin utilizing these design patterns.
