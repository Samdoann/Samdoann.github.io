summary: "How me and my friends have used the same discord server since 2016"
---

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/discord-large.jpg">

Me and my friends have been using the same Discord server for almost 8 years. We initially started the server because I and two other friends wanted our private space to talk on. I played a lot of games growing up and with that made a lot of new friends, so we started to add people to our server, and at a certain point 
we realized there were too many people. We needed to start giving roles and making specific rules so it couldn't become such a mess that we might have to make a new server. I wanted to do my best to keep this server because it held so many memories, and letting that go wasn't an option. 

What I've learned from creating this server with my friends is that when it comes to making certain decisions on what to change about the server trying to communicate it with them can be very difficult. Even though we've known each other for so long, I had to learn how to communicate and it's very difficult because
everyone's perspective is different.
