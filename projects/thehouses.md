We've all heard the joke of holding the flashlight for your dad, just for him to yell or complain to you for doing it wrong. Well, this is my experience when it came to working with my just my dad to build houses in the Puna district of Hawaii. My dad insisted I work with him to build these houses
so that I could make extra money while learning life skills that I could use in the future. Me and my dad doesn't have the best patience with each other so there was a lot of yelling back and forth, especially when it came to being in the right spot, as a lot of heavy building material was carried just by us or by me
guiding him while he uses a machine.

These days of working with my dad tested my patience a lot, but at the end of the day, I just had to suck it up and do the job as it's not going to complete itself. I've learned how to control what I can control and let him control what he can control. I believe this is an important lesson because we all need to understand
that not everyone is on the same level as us. Some will have more others will have less, we need to adjust to specific conditions to make the best of each situation.
