Rebuilding an engine after taking it apart does not sound easy and it wasn't. This was our first group project while I was at Hawaii Community College on The Island of Hawaii also known as the Big Island. I was going to school to get my AS degree in Automotive Technology. I didn't have a lot of experience going into this field, so the first project seemed very daunting. The group members were assigned randomly and we started to get to work right away. We had our teachers look after us during every step to make sure that we were doing things correctly. 

Taking the engine out of the engine bay was the easiest part. After that, we had to make sure we labeled every little piece so that we knew where it went, so when we had to come back to it we knew where to find or put it. When we took out the engine from the engine bay we had to take out more than just the engine, there were wires, clips, covers, tubes, and many more. If we hadn't labeled anything and tossed the things we took out without care, it would've been impossible to put them back together. 

When it came to rebuilding the engine itself it was too hard, just needed to think of it like a giant Lego piece. We had a large manual on how to put back each piston, each rod, each bearing, and so on and so on.
