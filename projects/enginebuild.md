Rebuilding an engine after taking it apart does not sound easy and it wasn't. This was our first group project while I was at Hawaii Community College on The Island of Hawaii also known as the Big Island. I was going to school to get my AS degree in Automotive Technology. I didn't have a lot of experience going into this field, so the first project seemed very daunting. The group members were assigned randomly and we started to get to work right away. We had our teachers look after us during every step to make sure that we were doing things correctly. 

Taking the engine out of the engine bay was the easiest part. After that, we had to make sure we labeled every little piece so that we knew where it went, so when we had to come back to it we knew where to find or put it. When we took out the engine from the engine bay we had to take out more than just the engine, there were wires, clips, covers, tubes, and many more. If we hadn't labeled anything and tossed the things we took out without care, it would've been impossible to put them back together. 


When it came to rebuilding the engine itself it was too hard, just needed to think of it like a giant Lego piece. We had a large manual on how to put back each piston, each rod, each bearing, and so on and so on. There weren't too many complaints at this step because everything was mapped out for us to do, we just had to execute and do every step properly, or else none of it would work.

As we headed on to put the engine in the bay there things went pretty smoothly compared to our other classmates. We were the first group to put back the engine into its engine bay, and everyone was very excited. We took the car around the block with all smiles on our faces, we completed something I never thought we could succeed in. 

I've learned a lot of basic skills in this project, for example how to work with new people and how to communicate what jobs people should be doing to help the team. I see this as a very important lesson in this project because this skill is used in every field I can think of today. We learned each other's strengths and weaknesses and who should be doing what jobs. I learned that I didn't want to become an auto mechanic after my first year, but I decided to follow through as these projects we were doing in class taught me a lot more than just how to fix a car.
